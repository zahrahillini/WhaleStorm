Project title: Disaggregating Water Flow Data for a Single-family Household Using Supervised Machine Learning

Team Members: Valerie Bevan, John (Jack) Hanley, Vica Otrubina, Zahra Heydari

Dataset description:
To advance understanding of residential water end uses, this work is gathering data from a smart water metering system at a 4-person residence in central Illinois, collecting 1-second resolution flow rate data from February 2018 through September 2021, with a negligible missing data in between (due to power cut or other reasons). The data is collected from a smart water meter installed on the main water supply pipe into the residents’ home. This meter is a custom ally® water meter provided by Sensus and monitors flow rate and volume data at a 1-second resolution in units of gallons per minute (gpm). The meter can read a positive flow rate above 0.11 L/min (0.03 gpm), and the data are reported to 0.04 L/min (0.01 gpm) resolution. The water meter reports data to a computer running a Python script to parse the raw data into a suitable format for further analysis. This data acquisition computer logges the data as a comma separated values (csv files) for each day. These files contain (columns of our dataset) the water flow rate [gpm] and volume [gal] timestamped at each second. It should be noted that time is captured in the fromat of a string ( like "2021-09-04 12:00:00 AM") which should be later on changed into an integer in the data curation process.

Project proposal:
Our team is looking to create a predictive model of water flow data using single-family household flow information. we are planning to disaggeragate 1-second resolution smart water meter data from a 4-person household over a certain amount of time. Using supervised machine learning, we aim to classify water events based on information collected from the appliance/fixture end uses. For the purpose of supervised learning, 4 weeks of our dataset has been labeled using a water diary. We will disaggregat the data using a set of labeled water end-use events in order to train our data (3 weeks of data will be used for training) to further on either dissagregate accumulated flows from concurent events, or simply classify signle-event end-uses to a certain appliance (1 week of data will be used for testing). By the end of the semester, water flows from showers, sinks, toilets, etc., will be automatically classified based on their characteristics with a certain degree of uncertainty. For example, the user will be able to see how much water was used for showers, dishwashing, or restrooms in their household over a given time period. Predictive modeling of flow data will eliminate the extremely time consuming process of flow segregation. Such processing is extremely important to the Water-Energy nexus research field of Civil and Environnmental Engineering. These results provide insight into specific water conservation and efficiency opportunities within the household (e.g., reduced shower durations), including the reduction of water consumption during peak demand hours. The widespread implementation of this type of smart water metering and disaggregation system could improve water conservation and efficiency on a larger scale and reduce stress on local infrastructure systems and water resources while allowing researchers to dedicate more of their time to the development of feedback tactics to promote water conservation among industry and consumers.

Plan of action:
- Clean up the raw data to filter out redundant rows, unnessissary column containing information that will not be used for this project (such as tempreture and pressure).
- Outline the project timeline and set-up reoccuring meetings.
- Separate the flow information for each of the group members to process.
- Label the data 
- Train the data based on further modules we learn in class
- build final model based on performance rate (using the testing set)
